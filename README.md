# Redbus Data Scraping and Filtering with Streamlit Application
Overview
The Redbus Data Scraping and Filtering with Streamlit Application project aims to revolutionize the transportation industry by providing a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing bus travel data. This project leverages Selenium for web scraping to automate the extraction of detailed information from the Redbus website, including bus routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability. The data collected is stored in a structured SQL database, making it easily accessible for analysis and visualization through an interactive Streamlit application.

Project Goals
Automated Data Collection: Use Selenium to scrape data on bus routes, schedules, prices, seat availability, and other relevant information from the Redbus website.
Data Storage: Store the scraped data in a structured SQL database for easy retrieval and analysis.
Interactive Data Visualization: Develop a user-friendly Streamlit application to allow users to filter and visualize the collected data.
Data-Driven Decision Making: Provide valuable insights for operational efficiency and strategic planning in the transportation industry.

Business Use Cases
The solution can be applied to various business scenarios, including:

Travel Aggregators: Provide real-time bus schedules and seat availability to customers, enhancing user experience and satisfaction.
Market Analysis: Analyze travel patterns and preferences to inform market research and strategic decisions.
Customer Service: Improve user experience by offering customized travel options based on data insights.
Competitor Analysis: Compare pricing and service levels with competitors to maintain a competitive edge.
